# Notes
- Clockwork is under active development. All interfaces and implementations are subject to change. 
- Official program deployments to Solana mainnet are secured by a 2-of-2 [multisig](https://v3.squads.so/info/7gqj7UgvKgHihyPsXALW8QKJ3gUTEaLeBYwWbAtZhoCq) and managed by the core team of software maintainers. 
- To deploy a worker node on mainnet or devnet, please [install](#deploying-a-worker) the Clockwork geyser plugin on your Solana validator or RPC node and request an earlybird token delegation in the workernet channel [on Discord](https://discord.gg/mwmFtU5BtA).
- Occasionally, a new software release may change the state schema and require users to migrate to a new program. These releases will be marked by a new major version upgrade (e.g. `v2.x`, `v3.x`, etc.). 
- The smart-contracts in this repository are automatically scanned by [Sec3's](https://www.sec3.dev/) auto-auditing software and are currently being reviewed by the team at [Ottersec](https://osec.io/). Their audit report is in progress and will be published soon. 

# Getting Started
- ["I am a developer, and I want to build a program on localnet"](#local-development)
- ["I am a node operator, and I want to deploy a Clockwork worker"](#deploying-a-worker)

# Local Development

#### 1. Install clockwork-cli.
If you are on linux, you might need to run this:
```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install -y pkg-config build-essential libudev-dev libssl-dev
```
Install with cargo:
```sh
cargo install -f --locked clockwork-cli
```

#### 2. Run a localnet node.
```sh
clockwork localnet
```

#### 3. Stream program logs.
```sh
solana logs --url localhost
```
